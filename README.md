## Project Goals
1. Implement Karatsuba algorithm to multiply two integers A and B whose values are less than or equal to 1000. 
2. Implement Exponentiation algorithm to evaluate AB, where A and B are two integers whose values are less than or equal to 1000. The maximum value of AB can be 10001000 which has 3001 digits.

## Requirements
- Built using C++17
- type "make" to build file (on linux)
- after compiling type "./main.out" to run file (on linux)
- Compiled using MinGW on local machine (Version: w64 6.0)
